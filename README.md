# FPGA Microprocessor in VHDL

This project implements a custom **14-bit microprocessor** in VHDL as the final project for the **Advanced Digital Logic (ENGRâ€“UH 2310)** course at New York University Abu Dhabi (Spring 2024).

The design supports a custom instruction set architecture (ISA) with arithmetic, logical, branching, and control operations, and is implemented and tested both in simulation and on an FPGA board.

## ðŸ“œ Project Overview

**Key Features:**
- **14-bit signed data path**
- **16 instructions** (arithmetic, logical, immediate, branch, jump, halt)
- **8 general-purpose registers** (R0â€“R7, with R0 hard-wired to 0)
- **128-entry instruction memory**
- Overflow detection in arithmetic operations
- Control flow via Program Counter (PC) and branch/jump instructions
- FPGA 7-segment display output for operands, opcode, and results

**Supported Instructions (ISA):**
- Arithmetic: `ADD`, `ADDI`, `SUB`, `SUBI`
- Logic: `AND`, `ANDI`, `OR`, `ORI`, `XOR`, `XORI`
- Shift: `SLL`, `SRL`
- Branch/Jump: `BE`, `BLT`, `JMP`
- Control: `HALT`
